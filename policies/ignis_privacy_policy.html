        The data the app collects is used by the google admob SDK which collects the following data
        from the device:
        The Google Mobile Ads SDK collects and shares the following data types automatically for
        advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention purposes.
        Data collected by default:
        ● IP address: The device's IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location
        of a device.
        ● User product interactions: User product interactions and interaction information,
        including app launch, taps, and video views.
        ● Diagnostic information: Information related to the performance of your app and the SDK,
        including crash logs, app launch time, hang rate, and energy usage.
        ● Device and Account identifiers: Collects Android advertising (ad) ID, app set ID, and, if
        applicable, other identifiers related to signed-in accounts on the device.
        All of the user data collected by Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted in transit using the
        Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
        Data handling
        Android ad ID collection is optional. The ad ID can be reset or deleted by users using ad ID
        controls in the Android settings menu.
        Aditionally, ads can be completely turned off in the settings menu, and while this does make
        the game not trigger ads, adMob still collects data from you.
