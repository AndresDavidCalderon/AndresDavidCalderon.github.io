    <h2>Sumamary</h2>
    <p>The package dev.andresdavidcalderon.integral, from now on "the app", does not send data outside of the user's device, as it lacks any online 
        functionality, and does not store any data on the device. The developer, Andres David Calderon, does not have access to any data of the user or device,
        and there are no ads or any other third party services that may collect data. The system shares data with the app according to the complications you use,
		but such data is not collected. Understand collected as transmitted off the device.
    </p> 
    <h2>Data collected by google play</h2>
    When you download the app from the play store, the fact that you downloaded the app and 
    information about your device is stored, including:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Android version
        </li>
        <li>
            Amount of RAM
        </li>
        <li>
            CPU
        </li>
        <li>
            GPU
        </li>
        <li>
            Highest version supported for OpenGL ES and Vulkan
        </li>
        <li>
            ABI
        </li>
        <li>
            form factor
        </li>
        <li>
            Screen size and density
        </li>
    </ul>
    While the developer recieves this data, the entity that collects it
    is the one managing the store front. As such, if you want to manage it,
    you will have to use google's tools.
    This data is collected to allow the developer to improve the app and fix errors within it.
    <h2>More about the app</h2>
    <p>The app, which is a watchface, is made with watchfacemaker in the XML format, which only includes declarative instructions and resources, but not
		code written by the developer, at least in the case of the integral formulas watchface.
    </p>
