        The developer (Andres David Calderon, identified in the play store as Andres David) does not recieve
        data based on the usage of the app, as such data is only stored in your device.
        However, some data is collected at the moment of downloading the app from the play store.
    </p>
    <h2>Data collected by google play</h2>

                is the one managing the store front. As such, if you want to manage it,
                you will have to use google's tools.
